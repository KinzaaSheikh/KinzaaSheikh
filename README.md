## About Me 👩‍💻

As a Computer Science graduate, I have operational and implementation experience of over 4 years of studying real-world problems and designing optimal solutions. I have also worked in an IoT hardware supply chain in an online e-commerce environment for over 5 years.

As a _**Full-Stack Web developer**_, I have experience in both frontend and backend technologies _[Django](https//www.djangoproject.com/), [Flask](https//flask.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/), [React](https//reactjs.org/), and [Angular](https//angular.io/)_. As a student whose coursework is focused majorly on _[Java](https//www.java.com/en/)_, and personal interest in _[Python](https//www.python.org/)_, I have an in-depth understanding of both languages and their applications in software development and data science domains. I have multiple certifications and projects in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence using _[Python](https//www.python.org/)_ libraries i.e _[pandas](https//pandas.pydata.org/)_, _[NumPy](https//numpy.org/)_, _[scikit-learn](https//scikit-learn.org/stable/)_, etc.

I also have BigData experience using _[BigQuery](https//cloud.google.com/bigquery), [IBM’s Watson](https//www.ibm.com/watson), [AWS studio](https//aws.amazon.com/amplify/studio/), and [NoSQL](https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL)_. Currently, I am pursuing IBM's Full Stack Software Engineer specialization and learning JavaScript in-depth with multiple frameworks and cloud deployment.
