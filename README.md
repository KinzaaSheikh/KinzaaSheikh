👋 Hi there, I'm Kinza Sheikh!

🔭 Junior Software Engineer | AI Enthusiast | Cloud-Native Solutions Developer

🌟 About Me
As a Junior Software Engineer, I bring over 4 years of hands-on experience in solving real-world problems and designing optimal solutions, coupled with my experience as a Full-Stack Web Developer, with expertise in Next.js and Nest.js, building robust, scalable applications for modern web experiences.

I specialize in AI-driven and cloud-native solutions, focusing on Generative AI, multi-agent systems, and humanoid robotics. My expertise includes fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) using technologies like OpenAI, PyTorch, and Meta LLaMA, alongside developing scalable AI-powered applications with Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform.

With a strong grasp of modern AI Python programming, knowledge graphs, and custom AI model design, I’ve built AI-powered microservices and distributed systems deployed via platforms like Azure. My work aims to bridge the gap between the digital and physical worlds through agentic AI and humanoid robotics.

👯 Let's Collaborate!
I’m always looking to collaborate on open-source projects in the fields of Agentic AI, Blockchain, and Cloud Technologies.
